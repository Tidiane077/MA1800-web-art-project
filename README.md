Web Art Project

My project idea was a web art colllage built around a concept I really like which is sonder. This concept ia explained in the project itself. This project involved a lot of experimentation, trial and error as well as me just enjoying the process. It took me quite a while to figure things out even with all the research done but it was done. The collage page itself had a theme of dreams and that everyone has their own individual dreams that they're often willing to give it all up to chase. It relates back to the original concept of sonder as every one you pass on a day to day basis has their ow individual lives where they are most likely chasing after something themselves.

The page isn't necessarily well polished or organised but I assure you that this is done on purpose to show the rawness and represent how messy things can get chasing after your dreams as a creative. There is never a straight route. You'll end up back at square one so many times before you eventually reach your final destination.

Challenges that I faced with this was for one definetely dealing with github's limits for video sizes. In my last page whoami a video was supposed to play in the background but I believe unfortunaely due to their size it was cut off and refuses to work now even after I transferred the video to mp4, reduced the sie and changed it. It just simply didn't work which was very disappointing for me. Overall there were many challenges throughout the process as well. As I mentioned a lot of the work was very much trial and error. For example moving everything in the right place using css was a very interesting process. Also with all the assets involved it was very easy to make mistakes and miss out small details such as a semi colon after almost every line in css. This was another challenge.

My work was inspired by some of our references in class for example 'My Boyfriend Came Back From War' with the way she imbedded links within text gave me an idea to try this but with images. Luckily we had done a similar activity in class so I went back over thst by myself to understand better. The collage was mainly inspired by my day to day life as a creative and images were taken from pinterest and edited myself. Here is a link to everything used: https://pin.it/dxRyjBVRA   
Another inspiration were the youtubers who taught me how to do certain things such as

If I had more time I'd definetly ensure that the videos works. I'd also animate the images in my collage and attempt to make it more interactive and engaging by letting users tap the screen to reveal more images.
